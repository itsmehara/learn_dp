### **3. Behavioral Patterns**  
These patterns focus on how objects communicate and interact with each other.

1. **Chain of Responsibility**  
   - Passes a request along a chain of handlers until one handles it.
   - Example: A support ticket system where different levels of staff handle specific issues.

2. **Command**  
   - Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing undoable operations.
   - Example: A text editor with undo and redo functionality.

3. **Interpreter**  
   - Defines a language's grammar and interprets its sentences.
   - Example: Parsing and executing mathematical expressions.

4. **Iterator**  
   - Provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially.
   - Example: Iterating through a list of songs in a playlist.

5. **Mediator**  
   - Reduces direct communication between objects by introducing a mediator.
   - Example: A chatroom managing communication between users.

6. **Memento**  
   - Captures and restores an object's state without revealing its implementation.
   - Example: Saving and restoring a game's state.

7. **Observer**  
   - Notifies multiple objects about changes in another object.
   - Example: A weather station notifying display devices of updates.

8. **State**  
   - Changes an object's behavior based on its state.
   - Example: A vending machine changing behavior based on whether it has money or items.

9. **Strategy**  
   - Defines a family of algorithms and makes them interchangeable.
   - Example: Different sorting algorithms for a list (quick sort, bubble sort, etc.).

10. **Template Method**  
    - Defines the skeleton of an algorithm and lets subclasses fill in the details.
    - Example: Preparing a meal with steps like cutting, cooking, and serving.

11. **Visitor**  
    - Allows adding new operations to objects without changing their classes.
    - Example: Calculating taxes for different product types.

These design patterns are foundational for solving common software design problems and are widely used in modern development.
