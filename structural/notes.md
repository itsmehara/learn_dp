### **2. Structural Patterns**  
These patterns focus on how objects and classes are composed to form larger structures.

1. **Adapter**  
   - Converts one interface into another that a client expects.
   - Example: A power adapter converting a 3-pin plug to a 2-pin socket.

2. **Bridge**  
   - Separates an abstraction from its implementation so both can evolve independently.
   - Example: A remote control (abstraction) for different TV models (implementations).

3. **Composite**  
   - Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
   - Example: A folder containing files and subfolders.

4. **Decorator**  
   - Adds behavior to an object dynamically without altering its structure.
   - Example: Wrapping a coffee object with milk or sugar decorators.

5. **Facade**  
   - Provides a simplified interface to a complex system.
   - Example: A hotel reception desk handling various services for guests.

6. **Flyweight**  
   - Reuses shared objects to save memory when many similar objects are needed.
   - Example: Sharing character objects in a text editor.

7. **Proxy**  
   - Provides a placeholder or surrogate to control access to another object.
   - Example: A virtual proxy loading a large image only when needed.

These design patterns are foundational for solving common software design problems and are widely used in modern development.
