5. SINGLETON

The **Gang of Four (GoF)** design patterns are divided into three main categories: **Creational**, **Structural**, and **Behavioral**. Below is a simple and easy-to-understand list of these patterns.

### **1. Creational Patterns**  
These patterns focus on how objects are created, helping make systems more flexible and reusable.

1. **Singleton**  
   - Ensures only one instance of a class is created.
   - Example: A single configuration manager shared across an application.

2. **Factory Method**  
   - Creates objects without specifying the exact class.
   - Example: A shape factory that can create circles, rectangles, etc.

3. **Abstract Factory**  
   - Creates families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
   - Example: A GUI factory that creates buttons and text boxes for Windows or Mac.

4. **Builder**  
   - Constructs complex objects step by step.
   - Example: Building a car by assembling its parts like engine, wheels, and body.

5. **Prototype**  
   - Creates new objects by cloning an existing object.
   - Example: Copying an existing document template for a new project.

These design patterns are foundational for solving common software design problems and are widely used in modern development.
